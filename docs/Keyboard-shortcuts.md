title: Keyboard Shortcuts
---
Every action in Mosaic should have an easy to discover button and keyboard shortcut, lack of either is a serious bug. In general holding your mouse over a button will show what it does and what keyboard shortcut is associated with it.

**Unstable** there is currently no way to change keyboard shortcuts.
