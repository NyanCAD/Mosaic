Welcome to the Mosaic documentation! Have a look around.

Take a look at [getting started instructions](Getting-started-instructions.html), or head over to [video tutorials](Video-tutorials.html).

To get more familiar, have a look at the [editor overview](Editor-overview.html), [library manager overview](Library-Manager-Overview.html), [simulator overview](Simulator-overview.html). Then ramp up your productivity with [Keyboard shortcuts](Keyboard-shortcuts.html), [annotations](Annotations.html) and automate your simulations with the [Python API](Python-API.html).

If you are managing a Mosaic installation, [PDK management](PDK-management.html), [Deployment](Deployment.html), and [Architecture](Architecture.html) might be of interest.

Items indicated with **unstable** are likely to change in the near future.
